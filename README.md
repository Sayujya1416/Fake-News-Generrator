üé≠ Generating Fake News...
Enter category (conspiracy/sensational/clickbait/random): conspiracy

üì∞ Generated Article:
Title: BREAKING: scientists secretly exposed by big pharma
Author: Dr. Smith
Source: TruthSeeker News
Date: 2024-01-15
Category: conspiracy

Content: In a shocking revelation that has shocked the scientific community...
üî¨ How It Works
Fake News Generation
Template Selection: Chooses from predefined templates based on category
Variable Substitution: Fills templates with random but realistic content
Content Generation: Creates full articles with introduction, body, and conclusion
Metadata Creation: Generates fake authors, sources, and dates
Fake News Detection
Feature Extraction: Analyzes text for multiple linguistic features
Scoring Algorithm: Applies weighted scoring based on feature importance
Threshold Analysis: Determines if content exceeds fake news thresholds
Explanation Generation: Provides human-readable reasoning
Detection Algorithm
The detector uses a weighted scoring system:

Fake Indicators (25% weight): Suspicious buzzwords
Credibility Indicators (-20% weight): Credible source markers
Emotional Language (15% weight): Excessive emotional words
Urgency Patterns (10% weight): Artificial urgency creation
Exaggeration (15% weight): Absolute/exaggerated language
Capitalization (10% weight): Excessive caps usage
Punctuation (5% weight): Exclamation/question patterns
üéì Educational Purpose
This application is designed for educational and research purposes:

NLP Learning: Demonstrates text analysis techniques
AI Ethics: Shows how fake news can be generated and detected
Media Literacy: Helps understand fake news patterns
Research Tool: Provides framework for fake news studies
Web Development: Shows Flask web application development
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Educational Use Only: This tool is for learning and research
No Real News: Generated content is clearly marked as fake
Detection Limitations: AI detection is not 100% accurate
Ethical Use: Use responsibly and ethically
Web Port: Application runs on port 5000 (http://localhost:5000)
üîß Customization
Adding New Categories
Extend the templates dictionary in FakeNewsGenerator:

self.templates["new_category"] = [
    "Template 1: {variable}",
    "Template 2: {another_variable}"
]
Adjusting Detection Sensitivity
Modify the weights dictionary in FakeNewsDetector._calculate_fake_score():

weights = {
    "fake_indicator_ratio": 0.25,  # Increase for stricter detection
    "credibility_indicator_ratio": -0.20,  # Decrease for more lenient detection
    # ... other weights
}
Web Interface Customization
Modify templates/ files for UI changes
Update static/ files for styling changes
Extend app.py for new API endpoints
